# ProteinSearchEngine

This repo obtains all known proteins for a given biochemical reaction, and ranks them based on predicted relevancy.

Ranking algorithm uses the following factors:
  1. Protein size
  2. Known kinetics
  3. Known transformations
  4. Number of post-translation modifications
  5. Amount of literature
